# Obico Plugin - Print With Peace Of Mind

[Obico](https://www.obico.io) is a Machine Learning-based algorithm to automatically detects 3D print failures, send you alerts, and let you cancel prints from anywhere.

You can grab the server source code from [Obico server github repo](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/TheSpaghettiDetective) and get it up and running.
