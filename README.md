# Obico for OctoPrint

[Obico](https://www.obico.io) is a community-built, open-source smart 3D printing platform used by makers, enthusiasts, and tinkerers around the world.


This plugin requires Obico Server to work. You can grab the server source code from the [Obico Server github repo](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/obico-server) and run a self-hosted Obico Server. If you don't want the hassle of setting up and running your own server, you can [sign up a Obico Cloud account](https://www.obico.io/accounts/signup/).

## Setup
